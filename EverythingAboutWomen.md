What my Mum Taught me about Women
=================================

Here is everything you need to know about women.  It was taught to me by one of my favourite women - my mum:

• Always compliment a woman on her new hairdo.   (Even if it isn't that good.)
• Always compliment a woman on her new dress.
• Women really like a man with a good smile.  It can significantly increase a man's attractiveness.   Rafael Nadal is a case in point.
• Never mentally undress a woman.

The first three are straightforward but lost on most men I suspect.   The last is worth commenting on and also lost on many men.

I believe that almost all women can tell if a man is mentally undressing them when he is talking to her.   And I suspect that the vast majority of women find that unattractive.   An attractive woman in a beautiful dress or well fitting outfit should be more than enough for any man to appreciate.  Try your best not to let your mind wander further - even when they tempt you to - which they do sometimes.  It is not going to get you a date or anything like that.  And if you are in an ordinary context like a hiring interview, or trying to sell something, or negotiate a transaction it is not going to win you any respect whatsoever.   So don't do it.   And keep away from the porn and stuff - you don't need it.

Well that's what I think today.
