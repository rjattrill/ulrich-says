Ruby and Yoga

Why all good Rubyists should also be good Yogis

A yogi is a person who practices yoga.

Yoga refers to a lot of things.  Most people associate yoga with a set of physical exercises and postures emphasising strength, flexibility, balance 
and usually with an element of eastern spirituality thrown in.

Yoga is also a word that has been used to describe many spiritual and mental practices within many religions - mainly as a school within Hinduism - going back to times before the common era.  Meditation is a key common theme.

It is unclear to me how long the association between the physical practice of yoga - meaning postures - also known as Asana's - has really been around for.
Common belief is that yogi's who wanted to meditate better trained their body through postures to be ready to undertake long meditation sessions.  However,
some more recent studies seem to indicate that the physical practices of yoga are not that old and didn't just come from India but were also influenced by 
the physical culture movement from Europe in the inter-war period, contortionists from the lower castes in India and cultural exchange between India and Europe 
at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th century.

A Rubyist is somebody who programs in Ruby.

Why Should Rubyists Practice Yoga ?
-----------------------------------

### 1.  You are body, mind and spirit.

Your body is such big part of who you are.  

Your mind is your thinking - which is essential for programming.

Your spirit or psych or persona - is essential for living well in the world - with yourself, with other people and with your environment.

Yoga helps with all three of these things.

You might sometimes imagine that your mind operates independently of the state that your body is in.   But that is just not true.  You can observe that you don't 
function as a developer well if you are tired or hungry.   So as a developer - if you look after your body you will:

* Function better as a developer
* Function better as a person
* Be happier

As developers you are all investing time and energy in your Ruby skills. A perfect example of that is the fact that you turned up here tonight.

### 2.  You need to maintain good posture

As a Rubyist you may spend long periods sitting at a computer.   Just like a yogi might spend long periods meditating.  You want to develop good posture so that you 
don't get injured and don't get a bad back.   To be perfectly honest, I think that Pilates is better for posture than yoga - but you can do both.

Good posture will make you feel taller and happier.

### 3.   You need to be able to focus

You know that as a developer, you need to be able to concentrate.  You need to keep track of where you are in a call stack when you are debugging - and remember what has brought 
you to a particular piece of code.

Yoga will help you to learn to quieten your mind - to cope with distractions - and to focus on the task at present.   That can only help with programming.

Watching your smart phone or television won't help you to learn to concentrate. 

### 4.   Yoga will help you to slow down

Sometimes in life we need to go slow to go fast.  As programmers we might try and work really fast and make decisions really fast.  But then we make the wrong decision and pay for it
for weeks months or years.   Yoga will help you to learn to slow down when you need to so that you can make the right decisions about your creative work - whether that is a small decision about whether you should put the bunch of functions you are developing into a class or a module or a big decision like using Elixir instead of Ruby for your next big project.

### 5.   Yoga will help you to breathe better

A huge part of yoga is about breathing better.   If you can breath better you will manage stressful situations better.  We all suffer with stress.  You might be a new rubyist looking to get your first Ruby job, a mid level developer about to go into a performance review with your development manager or a CTO helping to pitch to investors for funding.  If you can learn to 
breathe better you will cope better in any of these situations.

### 6.   You will learn to leave your ego and judgement at the door

When you go into a yoga studio you are very unlikely to be the best or worst in the room.   That might be different to the place you work.  In the yoga studio you will learn to let go
of your ego and that will help you become a better coder - because it will open you up in so many ways.

### 7.   Yoga will make you think differently

As a Ruby developer you spend a lot of time hanging around certain personality types.  Often these people are highly analytical, left brained and often introverted people.  People in yoga studios are often very different.  You can meet interesting and different people there.  And yoga teachers are in general very different types of people to Ruby hackers.  While you are practicing yoga your yoga teacher might instruct you in all sorts of spiritual, psychological and other things that you might find helpful, interesting or just silly.  

### 8.   You will get some cool party tricks

If you can do Crow pose then you will have a terrific party trick to show people if the company you with don't know the difference between a lambda and a proc or don't know the difference between Vi, Emacs or Atom.

Are These Benefits Guaranteed?

No.

But it can't hurt to try.
